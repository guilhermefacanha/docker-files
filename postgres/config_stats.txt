Configure PostgreSQL

Add the following entries to your postgres.conf:

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'

# Increase the max size of the query strings Postgres records
track_activity_query_size = 2048

# Track statements generated by stored procedures as well
pg_stat_statements.track = all


#On SQL:
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;

#SQL Example
SELECT * 
FROM pg_stat_statements;
